<b>This is an HTML Sign-Up Form that collects user information like name, mobile number, email, date of birth, gender, skills, and password. The form consists of several input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and buttons for submission and reset.</b>

Breakdown of the Code:
HTML Structure:

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration specifies that this is an HTML5 document.
The <html> element defines the document structure.
The <head> contains metadata such as character encoding and viewport settings.
The <body> contains the actual form.
Form Fields:

Name: A text input for entering the full name.
Mobile Number: A tel input field for entering a mobile number.
Email: An email input field for entering an email address.
Date of Birth: A date input field to select a birthdate.
Gender: Two radio buttons (Male, Female) to select gender.
Skills: Three checkboxes for selecting skills (C++, Java, Python).
Password: An input field for entering a password.
Buttons: A submit button and a reset button.
Issues in the Code:
Radio Button id Issue:
The id="gen1" is the same for both Male and Female, making selection incorrect. Each radio button should have a unique id and the same name attribute.
Checkbox id Case Sensitivity Issue:
The id="Java" should be lowercase java for consistency (id="java").
Password Input Issue:
The password input field uses type="pass", which should be type="password".
Submit Button Issue:
The <button value="Submit">Submit</button> is incorrect because the value attribute does not affect the buttonâ€™s behavior.
